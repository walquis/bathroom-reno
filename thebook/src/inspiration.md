# Inspiration

During a 2021 Brauer reunion in Southern Illinos at the end of August, a relative staying at Mom's house tried to adjust the rain-head showerhead, and it broke off (not entirely her fault; it was piece of cheap plastic).  I took a look and told Mom it needed some deep fixing; the plastic pipe was broken off behind the shower. She said Why not just redo the whole shower? 

In mid-September, I took out the fiberglass tub and shower.  Mom had a local handyman put in a walk-in shower with custom tile; he got it done shortly before Thanksgiving.  Parts of it were inspired by Uncle Rich's DIY shower at his house by Lake Petersburg.  I saw Mom's shower, and went home thinking (a) it looked pretty good, and b) I could do better.

In early October, I put in a dedicated water heater for our master bath (more on that later), as a prelude to the upgrade.

When Grace and I stayed over at my sister's house during the holidays, I took a look at their bathroom they had done themselves.  I loved the Roman-style textured light tile, and decided to use something similar.  I also liked the bench, the wide grout spacing, and the use of large tiles.

I eventually found a travertine-style tile at Home Depot, "Travisano Trevi". That pattern guided me to further Roman-themed choices expressing a simple, uncluttered, calm atmosphere.  That pattern came in six-inch and twelve-inch sizes.
