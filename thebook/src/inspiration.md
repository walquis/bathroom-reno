# Inspiration

- Aunt came to stay during reunion, broke the arm off the rain-head showerhead
- demo'd Mom's shower, gained confidence that I could do same
- Mom had a walk-in shower put in. a) looked pretty good, and b) pretty sure I could do better
    - I did not realize how long it would take

Megan hosted us in 2021, and I was impressed with the bathroom they did, especially the textured light tile that they used. I liked the bench, the wide grout spacing, and the large tiles.

This eventually led me to choose the Roman travertine-style "Travisano Trevi" tile at Home Depot, and guided me to more vaguely Roman style choices expressing a simple, uncluttered, calm theme.
