It was difficult to get the valve hot enough to solder the copper onto it; the valve absorbed a lot of heat.

The fireblock foam (the orange stuff) is required by code.

I fastened the pipe for the hand shower a couple feet below the elbow, in order to leave some wiggle room in case I needed to pull it forward for tile clearance, but also keep it snug against the tile; and in fact, that is how it worked out.

Notice from the pic on the left that I had forgotten to put in water hammer arrestors.  There were some by the sink originally, but now they're gone, so these are extra-necessary.
