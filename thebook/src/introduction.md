# My DIY Bathroom Renovation

In January 2022, I began renovating our master bathroom.  It took me six months and was more involved than I expected (how many DIY'ers have said that before? ðŸ¤”).

By the time it was done, I was ready to do something else with my evenings and weekends.

That said, it turned out really well.  It's much warmer, more functional, efficient, safe, easy to clean.  I love the peaceful aesthetics.

The renovation required me to wear these hats: design, demolition, plumbing, electrical, carpentry, drywall, waterproofing, tiling, painting, insulation, window replacement.  Friends in the trades guided me, especially with the electrical and plumbing bits.  My brother loaned me his tile saw.  I am fortunate that Lisle supports DYI'ers by allowing them to act as their own contractors for plumbing and electrical (Downers Grove, for instance, does not allow that).
