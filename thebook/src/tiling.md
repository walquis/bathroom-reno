# Tiling - 1 April to 31 May

![](images/IMG_4255.jpg)

A trial layout, to see how the diagonal pattern would intersect with the drain and walls.  The broken pieces to the left are my attempt to cut a drain-sized square from the middle of a six-inch tile.  It became abundantly clear that approach was never going to work!

The drain grate, mortared into its final position.  See [Getting the Drain Waterproofing Right](waterproofing.md#getting-the-drain-waterproofing-right).

### First tile laid - 1st April

The shower floor is coming along well; the diagonal pattern aligns cleanly with the bench and the grate, and the six-inch tiles are laying nicely into the concave slope of the shower floor.

### More floor - 8th April

So many tiles...

### Laying Wall Tile - 30 April to 31 May

One tricky bit about the walls was positioning the tile seams horizontally and vertically to avoid awkward intersections with fixtures, floors, or corners.  I didn't want to deal with cutting and placing slivers of tile, which wouldn't look good nor last well.

Also, I needed to keep everything aligned all the way around the shower.

I started from the middle of the bench, so that it would align with the floor seams.  On the opposite wall, I started so that the steam vent, the cubby, the floor, and the corner would come out right.

Now I needed to make everything come together.  As I went, I realized I had a 3/16" height discrepancy that would have to be resolved before the courses met.  This was due to my uncertainty about exactly how the seam width would work out.

Careful work with a hammer and cold chisel is required, but it's not as bad as I had feared.
