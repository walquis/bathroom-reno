# Design Considerations

## Utility

Below is the old bathroom. We didn't use the jacuzzi any more; it took up a lot of space.  The old shower was difficult to keep clean; the glass doors required frequent washing. The caulk around the tub mildewed and needed replacing periodically--an arduous, time-consuming and messy job.  The openings in the unused jacuzzi accumulated black mold.

The ceiling box above the tub--presumably for keeping steam inside the shower space--made the already small bathroom even smaller.

And the vanity and cabinet were dated and over-large.

## Safety
The inside of the tub was slippery and slanted.  In addition, the glass door track was sharp, making it dangerous to get in and out of the shower.

## Design Wish List

### Walk-in shower, wheelchair-accessible
As we get older, a walk-in shower makes for one one less thing to trip over.  Grace requested a vent aperture at the top, to allow steam to escape more easily.  I made the walk-in shower entrance 30 inches wide, with no threshold.

### Roman travertine-style tile
As I mentioned, I went with the Travisano Trevi tile by Marazzi, inspired by Megan's walk-in shower, and 3/16" spacing.  The pattern and spacing worked well, and was forgiving to a newbie tile guy.

### Heated tile floor
My Uncle Bob put a heated floor into his basement when building his house outside Petersburg, and it was so nice to walk on!  I wanted to change the character of the bathroom; instead of being the cold room at the end of the house as a result of being a converted garage, and far from the furnace, I wanted to insulate it and heat it so that it would be literally warm and inviting.

### Conserving water
The flow control and temperature control on the Delta shower trim and valve, combined with a rain head showerhead, makes it easy to use only the water you need.  Additionally, the hand shower is usable as a bidet--something Grace liked when staying in London while visiting Lydia.

### Corner bench
Mom's corner bench in her new walk-in shower is useful; I made ours a little lower, and a little wider.

### A calming, uncluttered space
The old bathroom had a rather busy, jarring set of patterns that did not go well together.  I wanted the redesign to exude a peaceful environment that was uncluttered but not stark.

### New Window
The old window was single-pane, drafty, with a broken lock, and didn't stay up on its own.  The new window is well-insulated, can be easily cleaned from inside, and has double panes allowing it to be opened at the bottom or top.

### Lighting
A light in the shower itself helps make it welcoming.

### A big sink with plenty of depth
Sometimes I like to wash up in the sink.  The small sink did not lend itself to such practices.

## Challenges
- Getting the shower drain right.  Lots of engineering goes into a well-installed drain!
- Building and anchoring the shower wall (since it wouldn't sit directly under a rafter).
- Waterproofing the shower.  Standard drywall is not rated for shower walls, and waterproofing requires extra work and material.
- Embedding the heating elements in the floor, and wiring them to the thermostat.
- Wiring the shower light from the attic.
- Learning to tile and grout.
- Learning to replace a window.
