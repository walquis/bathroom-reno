# Design Drivers for Remodeling
- **Utility**. We don't use the jacuzzi any more.  The old shower was a pain to keep clean.  The glass doors needed frequent washing. The caulk around the tub would mildew and need replacing periodically--an arduous, time-consuming and messy job.  The openings in the unused jacuzzi accumulated black mold.
- **Safety**.  It was significantly dangerous to get in and out of the jacuzzi tub, the inside being slippery and slanted.  In addition, the glass door track was sharp, and painful to misstep on.
- **Aesthetics and Use of Space** - The jacuzzi tub took up a lot of room.  The ceiling box above the tub was there to keep in steam, but made the room feel small.

Design Elements and Features
- Roman travertine tile design (inspired by Megan's walk-in shower) - Travisano Trevi by Marazzi.
- Heated tile floor - Uncle Bob built a heated floor into his basement, it's so nice!
- Water conservation - I love the flow control and temperature control on the Delta shower trim.
- The hand shower is usable as a bidet.
- Wheelchair accessible - The entrance is 30 inches wide, and has no threshold.
- Corner bench in the shower.
- A calming, uncluttered space.
- No threshold into the shower - Avoids something else to trip over or collect dirt.
- New Window - the old window was single-pane, drafty, with a broken lock, and didn't stay up on its own.
- Vent aperture at the top - Grace requested it.
- A light in the shower.
- A big sink with plenty of depth.

Challenges
- Getting the shower drain right.  A lot of engineering goes into it!
- Anchoring the shower wall (since it didn't sit directly under a rafter).
- Embedding the heating elements in the floor.
- Learning to replace a window.
- Learning to tile.
- Grouting.
