# Shower Cubbyhole

![](images/IMG_4055.jpg)

I'm proud of how the shower cubby turned out.  I wasn't sure how I'd tile the cubby right up until I started piecing it in.  I had the wall done around it, and I tried a piece at the bottom right that just happened to line up with the seam.  At that point, I realized it would work beautifully to continue the vertical line right up the back of the cubby.

I tiled the cubby from bottom to top, the floor with a very slight slope toward the shower.  I sealed the edges with seam tape and redgard.
