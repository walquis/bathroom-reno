<p>In January 2022, I began renovating our master bathroom.  It took me six months and was 'way more involved than I expected (how many DIY'ers have said that before? 🤔).</p>
<p>By the time it was done, I was ready to do something else with my evenings and weekends.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That said, it turned out really well.  It's much warmer, more functional, efficient, safe, easy to clean.  I love the peaceful aesthetics.</p>
<p><img src="images/IMG_4740.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The renovation required me to wear these hats: design, demolition, plumbing, electrical, carpentry, drywall, waterproofing, tiling, painting, insulation, window replacement.  Friends in the trades guided me, especially with the electrical and plumbing bits.  My brother loaned me his tile saw.  I am fortunate that Lisle supports DYI'ers by allowing them to act as their own contractors for plumbing and electrical (Downers Grove, for instance, does not).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="inspiration"><a class="header" href="#inspiration">Inspiration</a></h1>
<p>During a Brauer reunion in Southern Illinos at the end of August 2021, a relative staying at Mom's house tried to adjust the rain-head showerhead, and it broke off (not entirely her fault; it was piece of cheap plastic).  I told Mom it needed some deep fixing, since the plastic pipe was broken off behind the shower. She said, Why not just redo the whole shower?</p>
<p>I did the demolition for her. In mid-September, I took out her fiberglass tub and shower, and then I backed away.  A local handyman took it from there, putting in a walk-in shower with custom tile. He got it done shortly before Thanksgiving.  Parts of it were inspired by my Uncle Rich's DIY shower at his house by Lake Petersburg.  I saw Mom's shower, and went home thinking (a) it looked pretty good, and (b) I could do better.</p>

<p>In early October, for our master bath I had put in a dedicated water heater (more on that later), as a prelude to my own upgrade project.</p>
<p>When Grace and I stayed over at my sister's house during the holidays, I took a look at their bathroom they had done themselves.  I loved the Roman-style textured, light-colored tile, and decided to use something similar.  I also liked the bench, the wide grout spacing, and the use of large tiles.
<img src="images/IMG_5343.jpg" alt="" title="Fall 2021" /> <br><span class="caption">Jim and Megan's bathroom</span></p>
<p>I eventually found a travertine-style tile at Home Depot, "Travisano Trevi". That pattern guided me to further Roman-themed design choices expressing a simple, uncluttered, calm atmosphere.  Travisano Trevi came in six-inch and twelve-inch sizes.</p>

<p>Much could be done to improve the use of space, safety, decor, and overall utility.</p>
<p>For starters, the tub and shower...  We weren't using the jacuzzi any more, and the tub took up a lot of space.  The tub and shower were difficult to keep clean; the jacuzzi jet openings accumulated black mold, the glass doors required frequent cleaning, and the caulk around the tub needed frequent replacement--an arduous, time-consuming and messy job.  The inside of the tub was dangerously slanted and slippery.  The glass door track was sharp, also making it dangerous to get in and out of the shower.</p>
<p>As part of a converted garage, the bathroom was <strong>COLD</strong>, located at the far end of the house from the furnace.</p>
<p>The ceiling box above the tub, for keeping steam in the shower, made an already small room even smaller.  We didn't take steam showers anyway.</p>
<p>The vanity and cabinet were too large for the space.  The vanity was dated, the repurposed kitchen cabinet wasn't a fit, the linoleum floor was old and peeling, and the wall tile decorations were frumpy.</p>
<p>The window was single-pane uninsulated glass.  The window lock was broken.  The counterbalance was also broken, so that the window didn't stay up on its own.</p>
<h2 id="wish-list"><a class="header" href="#wish-list">Wish List</a></h2>
<h3 id="walk-in-shower-wheelchair-accessible"><a class="header" href="#walk-in-shower-wheelchair-accessible">Walk-in shower, wheelchair-accessible</a></h3>
<p>We wanted the shower entrance to be 30 inches wide, for wheelchair access.  I wanted to avoid thresholds if possible.  They tend to need fixing, accumulate dirt, and make a tripping hazard.  A walk-in shower with no threshold means less to trip over--important as we get older!  Grace also wanted a vent at the top for steam to escape.</p>
<h3 id="roman-travertine-style-tile"><a class="header" href="#roman-travertine-style-tile">Roman travertine-style tile</a></h3>
<p>The tile in my sister's walk-in shower inspired the choice of Travisano Trevi tile.  The pattern and spacing work well together, and 3/16" spacing is very forgiving to a newbie DIY tile guy.</p>
<h3 id="heated-tile-floor"><a class="header" href="#heated-tile-floor">Heated tile floor</a></h3>
<p>I wanted the character of the bathroom to be warm and inviting.  I loved the heated basement floor my Uncle Bob put in when building his house outside Petersburg; it was so nice to walk on!  A heated floor goes a long way toward making it a desirable place.</p>
<h3 id="water-conservation"><a class="header" href="#water-conservation">Water conservation</a></h3>
<p>A Delta shower valve and trim with flow control and temperature control, combined with a rain showerhead, lets you use only the water you need.  Additionally, a hand shower is usable as a bidet, and saves even more water.  Finally, a dedicated water heater close to the bathroom minimizes waste of hot water coming all the way across the house.</p>
<h3 id="corner-shower-bench"><a class="header" href="#corner-shower-bench">Corner shower bench</a></h3>
<p>I liked Mom's corner bench in her new walk-in shower. I added one too, but a little lower and wider.</p>
<h3 id="a-calming-uncluttered-space"><a class="header" href="#a-calming-uncluttered-space">A calming, uncluttered space</a></h3>
<p>The old bathroom's busy, jarring set of patterns did not go well together.  My design goal was a peaceful cohesive atmosphere, uncluttered but not stark.</p>
<h3 id="energy-efficient-window"><a class="header" href="#energy-efficient-window">Energy-efficient window</a></h3>
<p>The window would be well-insulated, cleanable from the inside, and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/double-hung%20window">double-hung</a>.  With less frame and more glass, a new window would also let in more light.</p>
<h3 id="better-lighting"><a class="header" href="#better-lighting">Better lighting</a></h3>
<p>A light in the shower itself helps make it welcoming.</p>

<h2 id="challenges"><a class="header" href="#challenges">Challenges</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Getting the shower drain right.  Lots of engineering goes into a well-installed drain!</li>
<li>Building and anchoring the shower wall, since it wouldn't sit directly under a rafter.</li>
<li>Waterproofing the shower.  Standard drywall is not rated for shower walls, and waterproofing requires extra work and material.</li>
<li>Embedding the heating elements in the floor, and wiring them to the thermostat.</li>
<li>Wiring the shower light from the attic.</li>
<li>Learning to tile and grout.</li>

<p>As the first step in upgrading the master bathroom, I put a dedicated 20-gallon water heater in the crawl space just below and next to the bathroom.</p>

Along the way, I refactored a lot of piping. I removed a 3/4" hot water line running all the way across the house, which had been added when the attached garage at the north end of the house was converted to a master bedroom and bathroom.  It was taking a looong time to get hot water to the bathroom, and wasted lots of hot water in the process.
<p>I also removed a bunch of unused pipe that had been left in place from previous projects. --&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>It was an interesting exercise, re-attaching the dishwasher and humidifier lines. I didn't realize at first that the humidier was being fed <em>hot</em> water, although it makes sense; hot water evaporates more quickly, which makes the humidifier more efficient.  I discovered SharkBite fittings, expensive but awesome, especially where (a) one can't easily sweat a copper joint without setting something on fire, or (b) one might need to disconnect the pipe later for whatever reason.</p>
<p>In the latter case, a SharkBite fitting on the water heater's hot water line came in handy when I discovered the humidifier requirement; I popped off the fitting, added a tee, and popped it back onto the bottom of the tee.</p>

   <img src="images/IMG_3170.JPG">
 </div>
</div>
<p>Note that the tee isn't only for the humidier.  The humidifier actually taps into the line via a saddle valve.  The additional plastic quick-coupling fitting (not Shark-Bite brand) goes to the dishwasher.</p>
<p>It saves energy feeding the humidifier from a hot water source closer than the main water heater; less heat is lost with a shorter line, and the humidifier is more effective since it's getting hotter water.  Previously, by the time the trickle of water reached the humidifier from the far-off main water heater, it was merely warm at best.</p>
<p>Also, while running power to the water heater, I also fixed an ancient wiring mess to the oven.</p>

<p>I decided on ThermoSoft resistance heat pads, one in front of the toilet and sink, and one in the shower.  They needed to be buried in the floor, so I raised the floor around the pads using 3/4" plywood.  Total cost of pads, thermostat and sensors: about $600.</p>

<p>As I went along, it became clear that much of the insulation would need replacing.</p>
<p>I initially brought home some MoldTough green drywall, but then discovered that it isn't rated for showers.  So I took back the 5 4x8 sheets, and went with 0.42" "HardieBoard" cement backer board, which comes in 3x5' (due to its weight, no doubt).</p>

<p>It's crucial to seal the floor around the drain, all the way over the edge of the drain base, so that water can only go down the drain, even if it gets through the grout and under the tile.  There is no way it can get to the subfloor.  If that were to happen, I would have a shower that "failed".</p>
<img width="30%" src="images/IMG_4248.jpg" >
<p>I screwed the drain flange bolts partially in and taped the heads, so the RedGard wouldn't foul the threads.</p>

<p>Fastening the flange down over the waterproofing.  Note the weep channels and weep holes in the flange, to allow water to escape into the drain.</p>
<p>Floating the final slope into the edge of the drain grate.  The grate is aligned at a 45 degree angle, parallel with the edge of the shower bench.</p>
<p>Note the small gravel (courtesy of Lydia's fish tank supplies😃) embedded in the mortar. Under the lip of the grate, it is loose around the flange, preventing the weep holes from getting plugged with mortar. If any water were to get beneath the tile (the grout is not 100% waterproof), it would still have a route only to the drain and not to the wood subflooring.</p>

<p>I didn't need to RedGard the whole thing, but I had three gallons and didn't want to waste it.  If I'd known how much trouble it would be to get a smooth surface to paint on top of RedGard, I would have thrown the extra RedGard away 🙄.</p>
<p>Oh well.  At least the walls and ceiling have absolutely no chance of steam getting through.</p>

<p>I had very little experience laying tile prior to this project.  My brother Aric loaned me his tile wetsaw, and I watched a lot of videos.</p>
<p>I worked hard to think through how to integrate the dimensions and placement of cubbyhole, drain, fixtures, tiles, etc., aligning everything horizontally and vertically to avoid odd intersections.</p>
<p>Although grueling and tedious--it took two months not including the grouting--I am very pleased with how it turned out.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time thinking through how to align the tile seams horizontally and vertically to avoid awkward intersections with fixtures, floors, or corners.  Gaps and odd pieces wouldn't look good, wouldn't last well, and wouldn't be easy to keep clean.</p>
<p>Also, I needed to keep everything aligned all the way around the shower.</p>

<img width="30%" src="images/IMG_4444.jpg" >
<p>I started from the middle of the bench, so that it would align with the floor seams.  On the opposite wall, I started so that the steam vent, the cubby, the floor, and the corner would come out right.</p>
<p>Now I needed to make everything come together.  As I went, I realized I had a 3/16" height discrepancy that would have to be resolved before the courses met.  This was due to my uncertainty about exactly how the seam width would work out.</p>

<p>Prototyping a dark "Coffee Bean" grout...Nope.</p>

<p>The light colored is looking much better. Polyblend Plus non-sanded, #386 Oyster Gray.  (Pay no attention to reddish hue, it's the RedGard all over the walls and ceiling).</p>
<p><img src="images/IMG_4648.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Shower floor and bench grouted.  (The not-grouted floor tile is where I replaced a chipped tile).</p>

<p>My friend Bob, with decades of construction experience, shared valuable insight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do your best, and caulk the rest</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Caulk and paint make a carpenter what he aint</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also taught me the three phases of construction project management:</p>
<ol>
<li>The design phase</li>
<li>The build phase</li>
<li>The lawsuit phase</li>
</ol>
